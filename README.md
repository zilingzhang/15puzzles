This is a final project of computer vision course in Colorado School of Mines 2018. The Matlab program takes input from an image of 15 puzzles, recognize all the game tiles using CNN trained on MNIST hand written digits dataset, automatically orient the game board, then produce the optimal solution steps to return the gameboard to original state.
